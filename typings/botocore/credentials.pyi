        The ``access_key``, ``secret_key``, and ``token`` properties

        needed before returning the particular credentials.

        This has an edge case where you can get inconsistent
        credentials.  Imagine this:

            # Current creds are "t1"
            tmp.access_key  ---> expired? no, so return t1.access_key
            # ---- time is now expired, creds need refreshing to "t2" ----
            tmp.secret_key  ---> expired? yes, refresh and return t2.secret_key

        This means we're using the access key from t1 with the secret key
        from t2.  To fix this issue, you can request a frozen credential object
        which is guaranteed not to change.

            # I'm about to sign the request.
            # The frozen credentials are only used for the
            # duration of generate_presigned_url and will be
            # immediately thrown away.
