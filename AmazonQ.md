# Runway Requirements

- Ensure you understand the codebase in ./runway before trying to make changes
- Docs for contributing are located at ./docs/source/developers
- If we add functionality, ensure we update ./docs appropriately.
- Ensure we add a commit to git when we add code/functionality
- NEVER commit URLs, secrets, or sensitive data like parameter/env values
